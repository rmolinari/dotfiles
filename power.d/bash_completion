# Simple completion assistance to help with paths relative to $SVN_ROOT
#
# This works (sort of).  Why is it so complicated?
#
# Some of the many issues that I had:
#
# - It took many hours of experimenting to get this working, mainly because I
#   couldn't get compgen and complete to put trailing slashes on directory names.
#   I tried many different things without luck.  After poking around for a while
#   in /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d I had a few more ideas and came up with
#   what follows.
#
# TODO: also complete against files in the current directory (which are expected to
#       be the tilde-separated ones.)
#
_pushpull()
{
  shopt -s extglob
  local cur dirs files findpath match_prefix saveIFS

  # Allow for spaces in filenames
  saveIFS=$IFS
  IFS=$'\n'

  COMPREPLY=()
  cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"

  # compgen finds the files
  # ls -pd makes sure there are trailing slashes on the directories
  # sed strips off the SVN_ROOT prefix
  files=$(ls -pd $(compgen -f "${SVN_ROOT}/${cur}") | sed -E -e "s|^${SVN_ROOT}/?||")

  COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "${files}" -- ${cur}))

  IFS=${saveIFS}
}
